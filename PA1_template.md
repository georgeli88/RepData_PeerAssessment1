# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data

1. Load the data (i.e. read.csv())

2. Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
For this part of the assignment, you can ignore the missing values in the dataset.

1. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day


2. Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day


## What is the average daily activity pattern?

1. Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)


2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?


## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
